I'm a recent graduate of UC Riverside's Bournes College of Engineering with a B.S. in Computer Science. It was one of the most challenging and fulfilling experiences of my life.
In June 2023 I finished the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, and now I'm working as a freelancer, and interning at a small web3 startup.
